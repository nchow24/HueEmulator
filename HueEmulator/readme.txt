TO COMPILE PROGRAM: 'make'
TO EXECUTE/START SERVER: 'make start'

NOTE:

Use Emulator v.6 for group listing functionality

When logging in check "remember me" checkbox when logging in. 

Before clicking 'register' for a bridge, user needs to click the link button on the emulator 

If the emulator is running on the same IP as the application, use loopback address 127.0.0.1

The port chosen on the emulator must match the port entered when registering the bridge


The additional feature with Google Vision API was not completed because of SSL issues in https requests
The additional feature of color looping was not implemented because of emulator limitations
Thus we have created replacement additional features: 
	user can create a copy of a group with the same name and lights
	user can create a custom saved mode for their lights
